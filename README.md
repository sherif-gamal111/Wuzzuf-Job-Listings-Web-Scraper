# Wuzzuf-Job-Listings-Web-Scraper
A Python web scraping tool that collects job postings from Wuzzuf.net based on a user-provided job title and number of pages to scrape. The script extracts detailed information from each listing—including job titles, companies, skills, posting dates, status, salary, and full requirements—and exports the results into a structured CSV file.
